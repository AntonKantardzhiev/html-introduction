  <h5>A funny story</h5>
  <p>Before a few years,i was working as a cook on the river cruise ships. On my first day i understood that the personal
    it's not allowed espresso, and if i want i can by myself the capsules (for the machine in the personal lounge). I saw
    that the on schedule we ware departing from Budapest in 18.00h. amd my brake was from 14.00h. till 16.00h.I finished
    my work fast and gat out for coffee. The shop was on the other side of  the square behind a building. After 15 minutes ,
    I was already back with two big boxes of "dolce vita" capsules in a clear plastic bag . I was just on time to watch the ship gaining speed,
    getting on his way.  I decided to call them if they haven't forgotten something (me). Nobody knew that I was not back and "the schedule"
    turned out it was temporary. The have forgotten to tell me for the list in which I have to write myself when I go out(you tech one of the mirrors
    on the reception and it opens a secret drawer - not joking). The manager asked-do you have any ID (they take the passports for the border controls),
    I answered "yas". He asked do you have any money, I answered "yas" ,and in this moment he relaxed and said- we will reach Vienna tomorrow, we can meat you there.
    I am not going to explain about how I reached Vienna in March only with a t-shirt on my back and the coffee, how there was no receptionist in the hostel
    at 12  I booked and exetra , till I reached the ship somewhere in Vienna. You may be wondering where is the funny part. The capsules with which I traveled
    in the end didn't fit. Yes that's right they ware dolce vita and the machine was nespresso.  </p>
